# NWSplit58 

A 58 key split keyboard made for Nordic ISO layout. The keyboard layout, case, PCB and plate are all designed from scratch. Small additions like ports for the case is done in Blender, but 99% is done in Ergogen.

Firmware is done in KMK with the layout being very standard Nordic layout, with additional thumb keys and HomeTab mods to remove the command row. 

Head over i [WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md) to read about my process of creating the keyboard.
